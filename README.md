# Random Walker

this is a very simple implementation of a random walker. 


## what is a random walker?

> In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some   > > mathematical space such as the integers.
> 
> An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line, {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }\mathbb {Z} , which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or âˆ’1 > with equal probability. Other examples include the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas (see Brownian motion), the search path of a foraging animal, the > price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler: all can be approximated by random walk models, even though they may not be truly random in reality.
